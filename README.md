# SPHcodes
Run the makefile and create executables shear_cavity_dummy_part_sph.exe and poiseuille_sph.exe
```
make -f Makefile
```
command to run the program
```
./shear_cavity_dummy_part_sph.exe
./poiseuille_sph.exe
```
These codes are based on the textbook “Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics : A meshfree particle method” and "SPH3DOnTheBook" code by G.R. Liu and M.B. Liu. 2D shear driven flow is solved using dummy particle method and periodic boundary condition is adopted to solve Poiseuille flow.
